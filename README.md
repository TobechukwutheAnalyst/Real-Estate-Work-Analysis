# Real Estate Data Analysis

## Problem Statement

In this project, we aim to explore property assessment and sales data to facilitate informed decision-making in the real estate domain. The dataset at hand is comprehensive, encompassing various attributes related to property assessment and sales transactions. Key features include assessed value, sale amount, sales ratio, property type, and more. By analyzing this dataset, we strive to gain valuable insights into the real estate landscape, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.

## Project Overview

1. **Objective:** Explore and analyze the provided real estate dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights.

2. **Dataset Information:**
   - **Columns:** Assessed value, sale amount, sales ratio, property type, date of sale, and more.
   - **Scope:** Sales transactions with a sale price of $2,000 or greater occurring between October 1 and September 30 of each year.

## Analysis Goals

### 1. Assessment Accuracy
Evaluate the accuracy of property assessments by comparing assessed values with actual sale amounts. Identify and address any discrepancies to improve assessment precision.

### 2. Market Trends
Analyze sales ratios to uncover trends in property market values. Understand how sale amounts relate to assessed values across different property types and residential classifications.

### 3. Geographical Analysis
Investigate variations in assessed values, sales amounts, and market ratios across different towns. Provide localized insights to aid in regional planning and investment decisions.

### 4. Property Type Impact
Examine the impact of property types on assessment accuracy and market trends. Explore whether certain property types exhibit distinct patterns.

### 5. Non-Use Code Insights
Explore the significance of non-use codes in property assessment. Investigate how these codes influence assessed values and sales transactions.

### 6. Assessor and OPM Remarks
Analyze remarks provided by assessors and the Office of Policy and Management (OPM). Identify factors influencing assessment decisions and potential areas for improvement.

## Code Structure

The project code is organized into several sections, each corresponding to a specific analysis goal. The Python code utilizes popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform exploratory data analysis and generate visualizations.

## Conclusion

By conducting a comprehensive data analysis of the real estate dataset, we aim to empower stakeholders with actionable insights for better decision-making and improved accuracy in property assessments. The results obtained from this analysis can guide strategic planning, marketing efforts, and overall business strategies within the real estate sector. Below are some recommendations based on the data analysis and Visualiztions obtained.
